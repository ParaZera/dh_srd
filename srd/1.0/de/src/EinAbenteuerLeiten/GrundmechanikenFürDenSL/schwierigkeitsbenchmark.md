# schwierigkeitsbenchmark
The Difficulty of an attack roll against an adversary is equal 
to the adversary’s Difficulty score. The Difficulty of any other 
action rolls against an adversary is equal to the adversary’s 
Difficulty score, plus (if applicable) the value of one of the 
adversary relevant Experience modifiers. 
When a player makes an action roll without a specified 
Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty according to the totality 
of the circumstances. Refer to the following benchmark table 
for more guidance:
