As the GM, you have GM moves that change the story in 
response to the players’ actions. GM moves aren’t bound by 
specific spells or effects—when you make a GM move, you 
can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.
GM moves happen during GM turns. A GM turn begins when 
the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight 
passes back to the players.
WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE
The GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the 
frequency and severity depends on the type of story you’re 
telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the 
session you’re running.
Make a GM move when the players:
• Roll with Fear
• Fail an action roll
• Do something that has unavoidable consequences
• Give you a “golden opportunity” (an opening that demands 
an immediate response)
• Look to you for what happens next
CHOOSING GM MOVES
The result of a player’s action roll determines your response:
On a Critical Success, you let the player describe their 
success, then give them an additional opportunity or 
advantage.
On a Success with Hope, you let the player describe their 
success, then you show how the world reacts to it.
On a Success with Fear, you work with the player to 
describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM 
move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or 
cost:
• An adversary attacks
• The PC marks a Stress
• You introduce a new threat
• You raise the stakes of the conflict
On a Failure with Hope, you describe how the PC fails to 
get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a 
minor consequence, complication, or cost:
• An adversary attacks
• The PC marks a Stress
• You introduce a new threat
• You raise the stakes of the conflict
On a Failure with Fear, you describe how things go wrong, 
then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence, 
complication, or cost:
• You put them in immediate danger
• They become the focus of multiple adversaries
• They are separated from their party
• They lose an important opportunity for good.
QUICK REFERENCE:  
RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS
If you’re unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick 
phrases:
Success with Hope: Yes, and… (You get what you want and 
gain a Hope.)
Success with Fear: Yes, but… (You get what you want, but 
there’s a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)
Failure with Hope: No, but… (Things don’t go as planned, 
but you gain a Hope.)
Failure with Fear: No, and… (Things don’t go as planned 
and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)
If the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, 
draw inspiration from the “Example GM Moves” list:
• Introduce a new obstacle or enemy
• Ask the player what happens
• Have the PC mark a Stress
• Tell the players “everything is fine… for now.”
SOFT AND HARD MOVES
Soft moves go easier on the players—they give the party new 
information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to 
react to it. Hard moves are harsher, more impactful, or more 
direct—the PCs don’t get an opening to interrupt, alter, or 
anticipate the outcome.
Use softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on 
rolls with Fear.
