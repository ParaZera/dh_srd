GIVING ADVANTAGE AND 
DISADVANTAGE
To viscerally convey how a PC’s actions or circumstances 
affect their ability to act, grant them advantage die (or impose 
disadvantage die) instead of adjusting the Difficulty of an 
action roll.
ADVERSARY ACTION ROLLS
By default, adversaries don’t normally make action rolls except 
for attack rolls and any unique actions described in their 
stat blocks. Any other action an adversary attempts simply 
succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversary’s 
action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant PCs make 
reaction rolls instead. 
However, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the 
PCs can’t influence, you can give an adversary an action roll 
anyway. For an adversary’s action roll, roll a d20. If the result 
is equal to or greater than the action’s Difficulty, the action 
succeeds—otherwise it fails. You can spend a Fear before 
rolling to add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat 
block to the total. Use the same procedure when an adversary 
makes a reaction roll.
ADVERSARY ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE
If an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the GM rolls 
an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. If an adversary 
has disadvantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 
and counts only the lower result.
ADVERSARY ATTACKS
When an adversary attacks a PC, the GM rolls a d20 and adds 
the adversary’s Attack Modifier to the result. If the total meets 
or beats the target’s Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, 
it fails. Before rolling, the GM can grant the attacking 
adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a Fear to 
add a relevant Experience from the adversary’s stat block to 
the total.
On a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their 
stat block to the target. 
When an adversary’s action lets the GM make an attack 
against multiple targets, they make one attack roll and 
compare it to each target’s Evasion separately.
