ADAPTING ENVIRONMENTS
Sometimes you want to use an environment but it’s at the 
wrong tier for your party. Or you might want to replace 
a feature or two, then present it as an entirely different 
environment. Whether planning your session or even 
improvising an environment mid-session, you can adjust an 
existing environment’s stat block to fit the needs of your 
scene or improvise elements as needed. The environments 
framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle 
creativity.
When you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different 
tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those 
listed on the Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the 
column that corresponds to your party’s tier.
