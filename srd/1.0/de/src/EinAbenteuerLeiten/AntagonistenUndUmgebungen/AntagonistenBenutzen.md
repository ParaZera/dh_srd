USING ADVERSARIES
ADVERSARY STAT BLOCKS
All the information required to run an adversary is contained 
in their stat block. An adversary’s stat block includes their: 
NAME
Each stat block has a unique name. Abilities that affect 
adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who 
use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.
TIER
Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain tier. If 
you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, 
adjust their stats.
TYPE
The adversary’s type appears alongside their tier. An 
adversary’s type represents the role they play in a conflict. 
The adversary types are:
• Bruisers: tough; deliver powerful attacks.
• Hordes: groups of identical creatures acting together as a 
single unit.
• Leaders: command and summon other adversaries.
• Minions: easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.
• Ranged: fragile in close encounters but deal high damage 
at range.
• Skulks: maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush 
opponents.
• Socials: present challenges around conversation instead 
of combat.
• Solos: present a formidable challenge to a whole party, 
with or without support.
• Standards: representative of their fictional group.
• Supports: enhance their allies and disrupt their 
opponents.
DESCRIPTION
A summary of the adversary's appearance and demeanor.
MOTIVES & TACTICS
Suggusted impulses, actions and goals for the adversary.
DIFFICULTY
The Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless 
otherwise noted.
DAMAGE THRESHOLDS, HIT POINTS,  
AND STRESS
These systems function the same way they do for PCs. The 
numbers listed after “Threshold” are the adversary’s Major 
and Severe Thresholds.
ATTACK MODIFIER
When you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or 
penalty to your attack roll.
STANDARD ATTACK
A description of the adversary’s primary mode of inflicting 
harm on the PCs. It includes the attack’s name, its effective 
range, and the damage it deals on a success. Using an 
adversary’s standard attack is a GM move.
EXPERIENCE (OPTIONAL)
The GM can spend a Fear to add an adversary’s relevant 
Experience to raise their attack roll or increase the Difficulty of 
a roll made against them.
EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES:
Acrobatics
Hunt from Above
Navigation
Ambusher
Intimidation
Nobility
Bartering
Intrusion
Quick Reflexes
Blademaster
Keen Senses
Socialite
Bodyguard
Magical 
Knowledge
Stealth
Commander
Nature’s Friend
Tracker
FEATURE(S)
There are three kinds of adversary features: actions, 
reactions, and passives. Note: each adversaries stress 
is tracked individually. If a feature requires the GM to 
spend Stress to activate it, the Stress must come from the 
adversary whose feature is being activate. If a feature has a 
Fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any Fear 
already spent—for instance, to interrupt the PCs and put the 
spotlight on the adversary.
• Actions: a special attack or other unique action that the 
adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them.
• Reactions: special effects that take effect when their 
trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on 
the adversary.
• Passives: special abilities that remain in effect by default 
and require no resources or triggers to activate.
FEAR FEATURE(S)
High-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate.
EXAMPLE ADVERSARY FEATURES:
ACTIONS
Haymaker - Action: Make an attack against a target within 
Very Close range. On a success, deal X direct physical 
damage.
Shredding Strike - Action: Make an attack against a target 
within Very Close range. On a success, deal X physical 
damage and the target must mark an Armor Slot without 
gaining its benefit (they can still use armor to reduce the 
damage).
More Where That Came From - Action: Summon three 
Jagged Knife Lackeys, who appear at Far range.
REACTIONS
Heavy Hitter - Reaction: When this adversary deals 
damage with a standard attack, you can spend a Fear to 
gain a +X bonus to the damage roll.
Team-Up - Reaction: When another adversary within Very 
Close range of this adversary deals X damage to a creature, 
you can mark a Stress to make a standard attack against 
that same creature. On a success, combine the damage.
Momentum - Reaction: When this adversary makes a 
successful attack against a PC, you gain a Fear.
PASSIVES
Horde (X) - Passive: When the Horde has marked half or 
more of their HP, their standard attack deals X damage 
instead. 
Minion (X) - Passive: This adversary is defeated when they 
take any damage. For every X damage a PC deals to this 
adversary, defeat an additional Minion within range the 
attack would succeed against.
Relentless (X) - Passive: This adversary can be spotlighted 
up to X times per GM turn. Spend Fear as usual to spotlight 
them.
Slow - Passive: When you spotlight this adversary and they 
don’t have a token on their stat block, they can’t act yet. 
Place a token on their stat block and describe what they’re 
preparing to do. When you spotlight this adversary and 
they have a token on their stat block, clear the token and 
they can act.
Arcane Form - Passive: This adversary is resistant to magic 
damage.
Armored Carapace - Passive: When this adversary takes 
physical damage, reduce it by X.
FEAR FEATURES
Explosion - Action: Spend a Fear to erupt in a fiery 
explosion. Make an attack against all targets within Close 
range. Targets the adversary succeeds against take 1d8 
magic damage and are knocked back to Far range.
